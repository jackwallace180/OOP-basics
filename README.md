#OOP basics :taco:

this is a class with the basics of 42

## this class will cover

 - 4 pillars
    - abstaction
    - encapulation
    - inheritance
    - best of practices of organisation
    
  ## definitions
  
  ### class()
  classes are a collection of methods, they are the cookie cutters for object/instances of a class
  
  ### instance
  it is a specific example of the class. it is NOT the class, they are unique
  
  ### self
  self refers to the instance on which the method is being called
  
  ###methods
  functions that can only be used by/on this classes instant
  
  ## 4 P's
  ### abstraction
  is hiding complexity from the user and exposing only useful parts
  to get something done
  
  an example would be turning on a microwave, using the start button
  we dont need to know about the particle vibrations and resonance - 
  We just need to know our food will be warm
  
  ### Inheritance
  the ability to inherit behaviours and characteristics from a parent class
